"""
This is script for use logical decisions based on args obtained.

Later I will add here scenarios.

    If file is .tplpre we need to
        - check imports and add if any (args based)
        - run TPLPreprocessor on it and check results (ALWAYS for tplpre but based or args (file|dir))
        - run Syntax check  (args based)
        - ask ADDM for ver and zip tpl folder (args based)
        - upload tpl folder into ADDM (args based)
        - start scan in mode: (args based)
        - check query (args based)
        - generate model file (args based)
        - generate used query file (args based)
